 I am a dynamic young professional with a background in non-profit and higher ed who recently pivoted into tech as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I am currently expanding my portfolio (available in my bio and repo), and 🌱 learning more about all things JavaScript. 
 
 💬 Ask me about: 🪐 astrology (and check out my 'Horoscope' repo for my very first (baby) project on JavaScript.)
